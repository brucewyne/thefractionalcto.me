## Local Development

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

### Running tailwind compiler locally
```bash
$ yarn tailwind:watch
```

## Production Deployment

Production basically follows these steps:
1. Run `yarn tailwind` to compile the CSS.
2. Run `yarn lint` and shit to make sure I didn't screw it all up.
3. Not sure where it's going to deploy to yet.
